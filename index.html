                    <li>Place the other slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese</li>
                    <li>Wait approximately 1 to 2 minutes (or till the bread touching the skillet is a golden brown)</li>
                    <li>Flip the sandwich over with some awesome pizazz and cock the other side till golden brown(approximately 1 to 2 minutes)</li>

                <h3>Note:</h3>
                <p>Grilled cheese is great on grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The result will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.</p>
                <p>Remember, Shaun says "Grilled cheese sandwich are a staple of the North American diet!".</p>
